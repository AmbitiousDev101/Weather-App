This Python code fetches and displays real-time weather data for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It sends a request with the city name and API key, retrieves the response in JSON format, and extracts key weather details like temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed. If the API call is successful, it displays the weather information; otherwise, it prompts the user to check the city name or API key.
